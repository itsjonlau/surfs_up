# surfs_up
module 9

Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to investigate and obtain the analysis of temperature trends for Oahu. This data is required in order for our investor W.avy to see whether or not our business proposal is sustainable through the whole year 

Results 
based on our results from both June and December Temps , we see that there is not a drastic change in temp from the two months. 
Min. Temp of June is 64 degrees while Min temp of December is 56 degrees. that is a difference in 8 degrees. while if you look at the standard deviation June comes in at 3.257  while in December the standard deviation weighs in at 3.745 the different between the two is 0.488

Summary
To conclude openning up an ice cream surf shop in Oahu would be a safe investment for W.avy. with average temps in december still hitting about 71 degrees, which is clearly ice cream weather. 
some other queries we could run to improve this analysis would be obtaining weather data because although the temps are right, if it rains often that could have a huge impact on both surfing and customers going out to get ice cream.
